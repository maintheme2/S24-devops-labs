## Which best practices were applied?

* Checkout Action: The actions/checkout@v4 action is used to checkout the repository code. This is a standard practice to ensure the workflow has access to the latest codebase.

* Python Version Management: The actions/setup-python@v4 action is used to set up Python 3.9, ensuring a consistent environment for all jobs.

* Dependency Management and Caching: Dependencies are installed using pip, and there is a cache: pip option in the Python setup step to cache the dependencies for faster subsequent builds.

* Separation of Concerns: The workflow is divided into separate jobs for building, security scanning, and Docker image creation, following the best practice of separating logical parts of the CI process.

* Security Checks: The workflow includes a job for running Snyk to check for vulnerabilities, incorporating security scanning into the CI process.

* Docker Image Building and Pushing: The Docker job uses Docker Buildx for building multi-architecture images, which is a best practice for supporting a wide range of systems.

* Docker Login and Push: The Docker job logs into Docker Hub using secrets for credentials, which is a secure practice to avoid exposing sensitive information.

* Docker Layer Caching: The workflow uses actions/cache@v3 to cache Docker layers, which can significantly speed up subsequent builds.

* Environment Variables for Secrets: The use of environment variables for secret tokens (like SNYK_TOKEN and Docker Hub credentials) is a secure practice to keep sensitive information out of the workflow file.
