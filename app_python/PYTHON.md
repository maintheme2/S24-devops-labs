## Which best practices were applied?
    
* Explicit relative imports: The script uses explicit relative imports to bring in the modules it needs. 

* Use of \__name__ guard: The script uses the \__name__ == '\__main__' guard to ensure that certain parts of the code are only run when the script is executed directly, and not when it's imported as a module.

* Function definition: The function call_time() is defined clearly and its purpose is evident. This is in line with the best practice of writing functions that perform a single task and are named accordingly.

* Code follows PEP 8 style guide.

* Ð¡ode has been tested locally (pressed F5 several times :grin:)
